/*
SecretKeyProvider is an interface that describes a source of of getting secret keys,
given a unique identifier.  It defines one method, GetSecretKey, which, given an identifier
of type byte[], will return the corresponding secret key.

A na√Øve implementation may be to reference an in-memory map, but it is also trivial
to implement a KeyProvider via a database connection.

In the event that an error is encountered in retrieving the key, an error should
be propogated up to be handled by the server.  The server will then respond with
a HTTP code 500 internal server error, and report the error string with its response.

In this manner you can provide more information of what the error is - a missing
identifier, an i/o error, etc.
